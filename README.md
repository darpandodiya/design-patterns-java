# Design Patterns for Humans - Java Implementation #

I wanted to strengthen my foundation of Design Patterns. I found one interesting guide on Reddit: [Design Patterns for Humansâ„¢ - An ultra-simplified explanation](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans "Design Patterns for Humans")

The guide reminded me of the "Head First" series books. Placid and easy to understand.

The examples given there were in PHP-7 so I wondered why not implement them in Java. And hence this repo.

Being in professional software engineering field since last couple of years, I've come across below patterns one or another time. Some patterns I've used unknowingly. Nevertheless, it's always great to have sound fundamentals.

### Simple Factory ###
Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any instantiation logic to the client
